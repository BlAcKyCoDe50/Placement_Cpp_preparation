Rule 1 : visit the adjacent unnvisited vertex. Mark it as visited.
    Display it.push it in a stack.

Rule 2: if no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack.(it will pop up all the vertices from the stack,
        which do not have adjacent vertices)

Rule 3: repeat Rule1 and Rule2 until the stack is empty.
