Degree of the node : no of the nodes connected 
path of the tree: the node traversed for reaching the destination node from source node
height: leaf node  to root node
depth: from specific node to root node...(all nodes have different depth on different levels)

Type of tree: 
    General tree     |  Binary search tree
    Expression Tree  |  Forest tree
    Binary Tree      |

1. General Tree : basic represantion of tree is a general tree.

2.Binary Tree: A tree Data structure where each node has at most two child nodes is called a Binary tree.
    used in range of applications like Expression evaluation,databases etc.

                   Types of Binary Tree: 
    |                       |                 |
Full Binary Tree   Perfect Binary Tree  Complete Binary Tree   

# Full Binary Tree: A Binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two child is called a full Binary Tree.
-> every node other than leaf nodes has 2 child nodes.

#Perfect Binary Tree: All nodes has exactly 2 children's.
#Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree that is Completely filled with the exception of the lowest level that is filled from the left to right.


#Binary search Tree: In a BST,the nodes to the left are less than the root node while the nodes to the right are greater 
                     than the root node.
            -> The BST is used in searching and sorting techniques.

#Expression Tree: it is used for simple arithematic operations.
